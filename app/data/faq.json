      "question": "What does automatics actually do?",
      "answer": "We fix how work moves through your business by designing workflows and building the apps around them — internal tools and customer-facing portals — so data stays consistent and delivery stops breaking."
    },
    {
      "question": "What’s the best way to start?",
      "answer": "Start with a Systems Audit if you want clarity and a plan in ~2 weeks. If you already know exactly what you need built, a Build Sprint can be the fastest path."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens in a Systems Audit?",
      "answer": "We map the end-to-end flow, identify bottlenecks and failure points across people and tools, then deliver a prioritized execution plan with sequencing and ownership."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do Build Sprints work?",
      "answer": "We pick the highest-impact items, implement them, and ship in weekly releases with a short changelog so progress is visible and decisions don’t get lost."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Operate work and what are the guardrails?",
      "answer": "Operate is ongoing delivery within agreed capacity. You can submit as many requests as you want, but we only execute what fits the capacity and weekly priority. Larger builds get scoped as a Build Sprint."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work with our existing tools, or do we need to replace everything?",
      "answer": "We prefer connecting what you already use. If a tool is actively hurting you, we’ll recommend a change — but we don’t force rip-and-replace by default."
    },
    {
      "question": "Who will I work with day-to-day?",
      "answer": "You work directly with the people doing the work. No junior handoffs, no account-manager telephone game."
    },
    {
      "question": "What do you need from us to move fast?",
      "answer": "One decision-maker, access to the relevant tools, and quick answers when we hit tradeoffs. Speed is usually a responsiveness problem, not an engineering problem."
    },
    {
      "question": "What’s not a good fit?",
      "answer": "If you want a dev shop, unlimited design, or brand/marketing work, we’re not it. We focus on workflows, apps, integrations, and reporting."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can we start?",
      "answer": "If you can grant access and name an owner, you can usually start within days. The bottleneck is almost always access and availability, not delivery."
